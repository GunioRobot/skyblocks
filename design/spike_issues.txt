state piece and level need setup manually in the game loop, kind of wierd
had to manually pick a starting figure for the piece, kind of wierd
bug in piece where it was using initial passed in figure instead of this.figure
  we need a way to prevent this (naming, options object, etc)
Math.floor missing in some field coordinates
Input was extremely responsive now, need a key delay for sensitivity now
Game loop needs to be written so that it cannot be updating more than once (concurrency)
